      <p>Please explore the following topics in your preferred method. You could use the help of an AI assistant, or you could
        use other resources online such as Stack Overflow, MDN, or Youtube.
        <div class="callout">
          <p>For each topic you have been given sample question(s) to get you started. However you decide to do your research, at
            the end of each week you should be comfortable answering the questions or talking about each topic. As we move further
            into the semester you will notice that the *topics* will turn more into *tasks*. "How can I use this thing to accomplish
            the task I have before me?" should be the question you are asking yourself.
          </p>
          <p>Whether using StackOverflow, Youtube, or an AI assistant, if you ask about accomplishing a task and you get code back
            you should always review the code line by line to understand what it is doing, and how it works. Then test that code.
            Don't just trust that it will work correctly.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Keep digging until you feel like you understand the topics and how to use them. Sometimes this might not take long,
          other times it could take a while. Keep notes as you do your research. Submit these notes in ILearn.</p>
