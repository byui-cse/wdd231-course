      Please explore the following topics in your preferred method. You could
      use the help of an AI assistant, or you could use other resources online
      such as Stack Overflow, MDN, or Youtube.
      <div class="callout">
        <p>
          For each topic you have been given sample question(s) to get you
          started. However you decide to do your research, at the end of each
          week you should be comfortable answering the questions or talking
          about each topic. As we move further into the semester you will notice
          that the *topics* will turn more into *tasks*. "How can I use this
          thing to accomplish the task I have before me?" should be the question
          you are asking yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether using StackOverflow, Youtube, or an AI assistant, if you ask
          about accomplishing a task and you get code back you should always
          review the code line by line to understand what it is doing, and how
          it works. Then test that code. Don't just trust that it will work
          correctly.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Keep digging until you feel like you understand the topics and how to
        apply them. Sometimes this might not take long, other times it could
        take a while. Keep notes as you do your research. Also keep track of
        your sources. Even if (or maybe especially if) you have done your
        primary research using AI, you should still validate what AI told you
        with an additional source or two. When you are done:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Submit your notes in ILearn.</li>
        <li>You should also turn in your sources.</li>
      </ol>
      <div>
        <h3>Topics:</h3>
